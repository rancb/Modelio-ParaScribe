# CoExplorer
#
# Model/Metamodel co-explorer for Modelio.
#
# Author: jmfavre
#
# Compatibility: Modelio 2.x, Modelio 3.x
#
# Target audience:
#   This script mainly dedicated to developers who need to understand modelio Metamodel,
#   for instance to develop scripts or modules. It allows the co-exploration of a model
#   and the corresponding metamodel.
#
# Description:
#   This macro allows to explore the set of selected elements by navigating at the
#   same time in the model and the metamodel. While Modelio' model explorer and property
#   sheets presents a "user oriented" view of the model, the CoExplorer will present
#   a view strictly in line with the actual metamodel. 
#   The set of all (non empty) features associated with each element is displayed,
#   allowing the navigation to continue. Note that the tree is virtually infinite and
#   that there is currently no indication that an element has been already visited.
#   The methods followed are those of the form getXXX(), isXXX() and toString() with no
#   parameters. A few "virtual" methods which do not have direct correspondance in modelio
#   are also added, in particular to enable navigation to and within diagrams.
#   The co-explorer allows to navigate at the same time the model
#   and discover a slice of the metamodel, the slice that is useful for the model at hand.
#   The explorer not only allow to explore ModelElement, but also other Java entities,
#   and interestingly enough the DiagramGraphic elements. In modelio graphical entities
#   are not modeled, but the exploration is made possible.
#
# Installation:
#   This script should be installed as a workspace macro using standard modelio procedure
#   to add macros. The options to use are the following options:
#      - "Applicable on" : No Selection. The macro is application on any kind of element
#      - "Show in contextual menu" : YES
#      - "Show in toolbar" : YES
#   This script is based on the content of the "lib" directory which must be copied manually
#   in the same directory as this very file. That is, in the directory where this file
#   CoExplorer.py will be installed by modelio through the standard macro installation procedure.
#   Ultimately we should have the following structure 
#          CoExplorer.py             <--- this very file
#             lib/
#                 introspection.py
#                 misc.py
#                 modelioscriptor.py
#                 ...                <--- possibly other jython modules
#                 res/
#                     assoc-1.gif
#                     assoc-n.gif
#                     ...            <--- other resources.
